Learning is best done by examples.

This is a collection of C++ examples
from various sources.

Folders

- r: various sources
- c: c examples from `cppreference.com`_
- cpp: cpp examples from `cppreference.com`_

`cppreference.com`_ were extracted with ``cppreference_com_examples.py``.

Pull requests with further examples are welcome.

Each example file contains the command to compile the file,
starting with ``g++``, ``gcc`` or ``clang``.
The result is placed in ``../_build`` and usually ends in ``.exe``.

To compile and run all examples:

.. code:: sh

  bash tryall.sh


.. _`cppreference.com`: https://en.cppreference.com
