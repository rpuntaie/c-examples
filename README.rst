Learning is best done by examples.

This is a collection of C++ examples
from various sources.
Most files, those starting with ``_``,
are from
`cppreference.com <https://en.cppreference.com>`__
(see ``_cppreference_com_examples.rst``).
I'd be happy to include pull requests with further examples.

The directory is flat.
The file names are short,
counted using letters and digits.

Each file contains the command to compile the file,
starting with ``g++`` or ``clang``.
The result ends in ``.exe`` or ``.o`` or ``.so``
Created example files end in ``.txt``.
All these files are ignored by git.

To compile and run all examples:

.. code:: sh

  bash tryall.sh
